PyQ brings the `Python programming language`_ to the `kdb+ database`_. It allows
developers to seamlessly integrate Python and q codes in one application.
This is achieved by bringing the Python and q interpreters in the same process
so that codes written in either of the languages operate on the same data.
In PyQ, Python and q objects live in the same memory space and share the same
data.
